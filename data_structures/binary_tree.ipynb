    "Tree Data Structure is very effective than all linear data structure in terms of efficiency and speed at getting data.\n",
    "### 1. Tree Terminologies\n",
    "**Node** = A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.The last nodes of each path are called **leaf nodes or external nodes** that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes. The node having at least a child node is called an **internal node**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge** = It is the link between any two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root** = It is the topmost node of a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Height of a Node** = The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depth of a Node** = The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Height of a Tree** = The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Degree of a Node** = The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forest** = A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.\n",

    "**Inorder traversal**\n",
    "1. First, visit all the nodes in the left subtree\n",
    "2. Then the root node\n",
